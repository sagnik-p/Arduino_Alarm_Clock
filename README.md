# Arduino_Alarm_Clock

This repo contains the files needed to make an alarm clock with arduino (nano)

IN SHORT : Clone this repo onto your computer, complete wiring, import libraries as zip, upload code, enjoy:)

You will need the following modules:
1. Arduino board (obviously)
2. LCD Module 16*2
3. DS3231 RTC module
4. DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor
5. 4 tactile switches
6. Wires/breadboard/Circuit Board to connect everything together

Wiring :
See here : [wiring intructions](Wiring_Instructions.txt)

Install Libraries :
These are the [ZIP file libraries](External_Libraries)
Now Open the Arduino IDE, Import the above two zip files as "Import Library as ZIP file"

NOTE: THESE LIBRARIES BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS. KUDOS TO THEM FOR MAKING THEM.

Upload The code:
Paste the code in the ide after importing libraries [code](Arduino_Alarm_Clock.ino)
Compile And Upload.

Enjoy your small and cute Alarm Clock :)
